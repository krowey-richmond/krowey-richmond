# Hey, I'm Richmond 👋

**Full Stack Developer in the Making | BSc IT Graduate | Building One Project at a Time**

I'm a recent IT grad who's all about turning ideas into functional, clean websites. Started with **HTML & CSS**, now leveling up with **JavaScript** and **Python**. My approach? Learn by doing—lots of building, breaking, and fixing things until they work.

## 📈 My Learning Philosophy

I believe in **learning in public** and **building to understand**. Every project teaches me something new, and every bug I fix makes me a better developer. I'm not afraid to google things, ask questions, or start over when something isn't working.

**My process:**

1. Learn a concept
2. Build something with it
3. Break it (usually by accident)
4. Fix it and learn why it broke
5. Repeat
